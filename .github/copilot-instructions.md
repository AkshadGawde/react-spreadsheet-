1. Goal
   Create a static, front-end-only React prototype that visually matches the attached screenshot

   React 18 (Vite or CRA—your choice)
   TypeScript (strict mode)
   Tailwind CSS for utility styling (already used across Gob)
   react-table (or ⚡your own minimal table component) for the grid
   No state management library needed—local component state is fine.

5. 2. 3. Pixel-close layout to the Figma.
         Google Sheet/Excel like spread sheet experience
         All buttons/tabs change state or log to console—no dead UI.
